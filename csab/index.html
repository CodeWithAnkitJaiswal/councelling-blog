                <h2>WHAT IS CSAB???</h2>
                <p>
                    The Central Seat Allocation Board (CSAB) is responsible for centralized counseling of all Engineering/Technology and Architecture/Planning undergraduate seats in NITs/ IIEST/ IIITs/ SPAs/ and a few other Technical Institutes funded fully or partially
                    by the Central or State Government (Other-GFTIs), together called the NIT+ System.
                    <br>
                    <br> CSAB counseling provides an opportunity for candidates who have not been allotted seats in earlier rounds of JOSAA to secure admissions in participating institutes based on their JEE Main scores and preferences.If you fall into
                    any of the eligible categories, make sure to participate in the CSAB counseling process!

                    <br>
                </p>

                <h2>MYTHS ABOUT CSAB.</h2>
                <b>Some common myths associated with the CSAB (Central Seat Allocation Board) counseling process:</b></div>
            <br>

            <li>
                <h3>Myth 1: Only top JEE Main ranks can get NITs/IIITs through CSAB.</h3>
                <br>
                <div class="curved-box">This is not entirely true. While top ranks have an advantage, candidates with moderate ranks also have a fair chance of getting seats in NITs/IIITs, especially in the later rounds of counseling when many seats remain vacant</li>
            </div>
            <br>
            <li>

                <h3>Myth 2: Once a seat is allotted, it cannot be upgraded.</h3>
                <br>
                <div class="curved-box">This is false. CSAB allows candidates to upgrade their allotted seat in subsequent rounds if they get a better preference based on their merit and choices.
                </div>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Myth 3: Filling too many choices will reduce chances of getting a good seat.</h3><br>
                <div class="curved-box">
                    This is a myth. Candidates should fill as many choices as they wish, in their true order of preference, as it doesn't affect their chances adversely.
                </div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h3>Myth 4: CSAB counseling is only for NITs/IIITs False.</h3>
                <div class="curved-box">
                    <br>CSAB also allocates seats in other centrally funded technical institutes like ISM Dhanbad, NITK Surathkal, etc.</li>
            </div>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h3>Myth 5: Branch upgradation is not possible through CSAB.</h3> <br>
                <div class="curved-box">
                    This is incorrect. CSAB allows candidates to upgrade their branch/program in subsequent rounds based on availability and their merit.</div>
                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Myth 6: One cannot resign after the final round of CSAB.</h3><br>
                <div class="curved-box">
                    Candidates can choose to resign and cancel their allotted seat even after the final round, though they may have to forfeit some fees.</div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h3>Myth 7: CSAB Has Separate Counseling Rounds:</h3>
                <br>
                <div class="curved-box">CSAB conducts special rounds for specific categories (like UTs and North-Eastern states), but the main counseling process is unified for all participating institutes.</div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h3>Myth 8: CSAB is Only for JEE Main Paper I:</h3>
                <br>
                <div class="curved-box">Fact: CSAB considers both JEE Main Paper I (for B.Tech/B.E. programs) and Paper-II (for B.Arch/B.Plan programs) scores during seat allocation.</div>
            </li>
            </div>
